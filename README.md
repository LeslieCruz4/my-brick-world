# My Brick World – LEGO Collection Inventory App  

## 📌 Description  
My Brick World is a simple web app created to organize and track a LEGO collection. It includes pages for an inventory, wishlist, and collection management. The design focuses on being clean, easy to navigate, and fun to use.  

## 🎨 Inspiration  
I built this project because I love LEGO and wanted a personalized way to display and manage my collection. This project was also a way for me to practice web design using HTML and CSS while creating something meaningful to me.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structure of the web pages  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  

## 🚀 Features  
- Inventory page to view sets  
- Wishlist page to track future LEGO sets  
- Collection tracking layout with a clean, organized design  

## 📂 How to Use  
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.  
3. Navigate through the pages to view the inventory and wishlist.  

## 🎯 Hackathon Submission  
This project was created for the **AI vs H.I. Hackathon (Make it YOU track)** by CS Girlies.  
The goal was to build something unique and personal that reflects my creativity and interests.  

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Add **JavaScript** for interactive features like sorting and filtering collections.  
- Implement a simple database or JSON file to save collection data.  
- Add a search bar and dynamic wishlist management.  
- Create a responsive layout for mobile devices.
- Build a **community feature** where LEGO fans can share their collections, trade sets, and connect with others.
